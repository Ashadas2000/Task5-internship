Titanic Dataset
Titanic Survival Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Overview This repository contains the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for the Titanic survival dataset. The primary goal of this analysis is to thoroughly investigate the dataset, identify patterns, relationships between features (like Pclass, Age, Sex, and Fare), and understand the key factors that influenced survival outcomes.

The insights gained from this EDA are essential for feature engineering and building predictive models in subsequent stages of the project.

Key Files and Contents File Name

Description

task 5.ipynb

The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the EDA steps: data loading, cleaning, feature inspection, descriptive statistics, and data visualization.

Titanic-Dataset.csv (Expected)

The raw dataset used for this analysis (not included in this repository, but expected to be in the working directory).

Setup and Prerequisites To run the analysis in the task 5.ipynb notebook locally, you need a Python environment with the following libraries installed:

Python 3.x

Pandas (for data manipulation)

Matplotlib (for plotting)

Seaborn (for statistical data visualization)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

Summary of Key Findings The exploratory analysis revealed several critical characteristics of the dataset, which will guide the subsequent modeling phase:

Survival Stratification: Survival rates were clearly stratified by socioeconomic factors, with passengers in 1st class having a significantly higher chance of survival compared to those in 3rd class.

Gender Imbalance: The analysis confirms a strong gender imbalance in survival outcomes, indicating that Sex will be a highly influential feature in the predictive model.

Missing Data:

The Age feature contains a significant number of missing values, requiring imputation or strategic handling.

The Cabin feature is mostly missing and is likely best used as a binary indicator (e.g., has_cabin) or excluded entirely.

Feature Distribution: The Fare distribution is highly skewed towards lower values, suggesting a potential need for a log-transformation to normalize the data for modeling purposes.

Passenger Class: The majority of passengers traveled in 3rd class.

How to Run the Notebook Clone this repository:

git clone [your-repository-url] cd [your-repository-name]

Ensure the Titanic-Dataset.csv file is present in the root directory.

Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

jupyter notebook

Open and run the cells in task 5.ipynb.
